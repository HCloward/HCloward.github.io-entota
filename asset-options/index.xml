      <title>Enforcement Profiles</title>
      <link>https://hcloward.github.io/HCloward.github.io-entota/asset-options/enforcementprofiles/</link>

      <description>Enforcement Profiles document information about the purpose, the implementation, and the technology behind rule enforcement. With this information, business and technical users can easily understand how rules are enforced and the impact rules have on the business. The profiles accommodate different types of rules: rules that are automatically enforced via enforcement technology (for example, the DSPÂ®), rules that are enforced via manual tasks, and rules that are not enforced but require documentation.</description>
