	"content": "The Migration dashboard, available with DSP 7.0.1 and later, provides visibility into progress and status associated with enterprise Data Migration efforts by giving you access to the most important migration project metrics.\nUsing this dashboard you can:\n Understand the current status of migration waves Identify any waves that are running behind schedule Ascertain go-live readiness for a wave  Whether you are responsible for one or multiple waves, across a single instance or multiple instances in the DSP, you can view progress against milestones to assess risk, determine a need for resource adjustment and communicate effectively to all project stakeholders.\nNOTE: The waves that display on the dashboard, along with their milestones and thresholds, are configured in the DSP. Refer to Configure the Migration Dashboard for more information.\nThe Migration dashboard can be used on desktop, iOS 11 or later, and Android Oreo, using Chrome, IE 11 and Safari browsers.\nThis topic contains:\n Access the Migration Dashboard When should I configure the Wave to send metrics to the Dashboard? When will Metrics Percentages Increase from 0%? When is data sent to the Dashboard? Project Waves Timeline Chart Milestone Details Migration Dashboard Detail Page  []{#Access}Access the Migration Dashboard If you are assigned the Migration persona, the Migration dashboard displays when you log in to Entota. If you do not have access to the dashboard, your Entota tenant administrator should be able to help, or you can send an email to your Customer Success Team.\nIf you have purchased a subscription for Entota, access it by clicking the menu link in the upper right of the Migration Dashboard.\nWhen in Entota, click the Entota logo in the upper left to access the Migration dashboard.\nNOTE: To access the Migration dashboard as you would an app on your mobile device, use the Add to Home Screen feature. It launches in full screen mode, can be switched with other tasks, and supports the device's default orientation.\n[]{#When}When should I configure the Wave to send metrics to the Dashboard? Configure a wave within the DSP to send data to the dashboard after the initial structure of the wave (wave, process areas and objects) has been defined and the first steps of Target Design have begun. The first metrics displayed on the Dashboard are Design Complete, thus there is no requirement to configure the Wave to send metrics data to the dashboard until after Target Design has started.\n[]{#When2}When will Metrics Percentages Increase from 0%? After the wave is configured to send data to the dashboard the metrics are calculated for all four milestones.\n Design Complete percentage rises above 0% once targets are assigned a design status of Design Finished or Complete in Target Design in the DSP. Mappings Complete is calculated across both field and value mapping and rises above 0% once a Target Design is synced to Map in the DSP. Rules Complete percentage increases once source and target rules that are defined in Target Design and Map have been assigned a status of Complete in Map in the DSP. Data Quality is calculated when a user registers a target report for each of the Opportunity reports and Error reports in the DSP. The calculation compares the record counts in each of these registered reports to calculate a quality percentage.  Flexibility is built into the Data Quality metric calculation. In the DSP, a user can register an Opportunity report and Error report for each target defined within the wave. In most situations, a single Opportunity report and Error report is defined using the Target Report syntax tv\u0026hellip;Sel at the top-level target for the object.\nFor example, for SAP Material, the top-level target is MARA (Material Basic Data). The Opportunity report counts all materials in the target table data set and the Error report counts all distinct material IDs that have an error at any level of the Material target data structure (errors in MARC, MARD etc). By defining the reports in this way, a simple calculation can be performed at an object level which is then rolled up across all objects within the wave. Refer to Configure the Migration Dashboard for more information.\n[]{#When3}When is Data Sent to the Dashboard? Data is sent to the Migration dashboard when:\n A wave has been created and added to the Migration dashboard following the steps in Configure the Migration Dashboard A wave that has been added to the Migration dashboard has the name, description, start date or end date updated in Console in the DSP A wave is deleted in Console A milestone is created by the user in the DSP A milestone is updated by the user in the DSP A user-created milestone is deleted in the DSP  By default, when a wave is configured to be included in the dashboard, a start and end date milestone are added and the thresholds are set at 0%.\nThe dashboard does not display data if:\n The waves have not been configured in the DSP. Waves have been configured but the end dates for all waves have passed by one month. There is an issue with the data, connectivity, or other errors. In this case, a link to Customer Support displays.  A wave does not display on the dashboard if:\n The wave has been configured in the DSP, but the current date is greater than one month past the wave\u0026rsquo;s end date The wave has been configured in the DSP, but has then been deleted from Console in the DSP  A DSP user can also configure metrics data to stop being sent from the DSP. In this case, the metrics data no longer updates, but does continue to display in the detail row on the dashboard.\n[]{#Project}Project Waves Timeline Chart The Project Waves Timeline Gantt chart displays all waves that:\n Have been configured to display in the DSP Have an end date that is less than 28 days from the current date  Waves are sorted in the chart by end date in ascending order. The wave with the next end date displays first.\nThe time span displayed on the timeline is based on the earliest start date and the latest end date for all waves.\nOn a desktop, hover your cursor over a wave to see the day for the start and end date. On a device, tap the wave once to see the details.\nOn a desktop, to view the milestone details, click the wave in the timeline, or scroll down. On a device, tap the wave twice to scroll to the details for that wave.\n[]{#Mileston}Milestone Details Detail rows are also sorted by wave with end date in ascending order. The wave with next end date displays first. If multiple waves have the same end date, they are then sorted by start date in ascending order.\nThe data is current as of the Last Updated date and time displayed in the upper right of the dashboard. Metrics data is updated hourly.\nFor each wave, the start and end date display, followed by metrics data related to each milestone in a detail row. All waves have a start and end date milestone by default. Additional milestones can be added in the DSP.\nThe following metrics display for each milestone.\n Design Complete indicates how much of the design work has been completed. This percentage is calculated as the total number of active fields within active targets where design is complete (the design status is Design Complete or Finished) divided by the total number of active fields within active targets, regardless of design status. Mappings Complete indicates how much of the field mapping and value mapping work has been completed. This percentage is calculated as the total number of total mappings opportunities for both value and field mapping divided by the total number of mappings in Complete status. Rules Complete indicates how many of the rules have been completed. This percentage is calculated by the total number of source and target rules for the active fields with a rule status of Complete divided by the total number of source and target rules (also called rule opportunities). Quality indicates the data quality of the wave. This percentage is calculated using the totals on the Error reports registered to the wave and targets (post load reports) divided by the total number of records on the Opportunity reports registered to the waves and targets (preload reports).  On a desktop, hover your cursor over a metric to view details about the milestone date, current percentage, milestone goal and thresholds. On a device, tap the metric to view these details.\nThe metrics percentage calculations listed above are compared to the thresholds configured in the DSP in relation to the milestone date. If the percentage calculation is equal to or greater than the upper threshold percentage, this milestone is complete and the detail row for the metric displays green on the dashboard. If the percentage calculation is between the upper and lower thresholds, the detail row for the metric displays light blue. If the percentage calculation is less than or equal to the lower threshold, the detail row for the metric displays red.\nNOTE: If a milestone is added for the current date, it does not display in the dashboard.\n[]{#Migratio}Migration Dashboard Detail Page Users with the Migration persona can view additional details about a migration project\u0026rsquo;s progress on the Migration Dashboard\u0026rsquo;s Detail page. The Detail page is also a dashboard, and allows you to understand prior trends and current progress being made towards the defined milestone thresholds per wave.\nThe data is current as of the Last Updated date and time displayed in the upper right of the Detail page. Data is updated and refreshed on the Detail page hourly.\nAll waves have a start and end date milestone by default. Milestones are added in the DSP.\nThe Detail page contains these sections.\n A Gantt chart displaying a timeline for milestones for the selected wave. As with the Migration Dashboard, milestones are sorted in the chart by end date in ascending order. On a desktop, hover your cursor over a milestone to see the the start and end date. On a device, tap the milestone once to see these details. The timespan displayed on the timeline is based on the earliest start date and the latest end date for all milestones for the wave.

On a desktop, hover your cursor over a milestone metric to see the the details. On a device, tap the milestone metric once to see the details. A line chart with history of progress on the current milestone\u0026rsquo;s metrics, using data collected metrics from the Start Date of the wave to the current date. The X-axis includes the beginning and end dates of collected data for the wave. There is a line for each of three of the metrics. The Data Quality metric is not tracked on the History line graph. On a desktop, hover your cursor over a date point in the line to see the details. On a device, tap the line to view these details. A table with details about each milestone\u0026rsquo;s targeted and actual percentage for the metrics. The actual value is calculated from DSP data. The target value ranges are the threshold values set in the DSP. A red icon displays next to those at risk values that are below the low threshold range for the milestone. A green icon displays in the first column to indicate a milestone whose percentages have met or exceeded their threshold values and is therefor complete.

The WebSocket protocol has some required HTTP headers that aren\u0026rsquo;t commonly used and tend to be stripped out by corporate firewall software. Below is an example of a BOA app client initiated WebSocket request to BOA cloud, and the response back to the client. All of the headers outlined in this example are required.\nRequest\nGET wss://api.igc-prd-na2.boa.ninja/events HTTP/1.1\nHost: api.igc-prd-na2.boa.ninja\nConnection: Upgrade\nUpgrade: websocket\nOrigin: https://igc.boaweb.com\nSec-WebSocket-Version: 13\nSec-WebSocket-Key: x3JJHMbDL1EzLkh9GBhXDw==\nSec-WebSocket-Extensions: permessage-deflate; client_max_window_bits\nResponse\nHTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols\nDate: Tue, 03 Apr 2018 15:03:00 GMT\nConnection: upgrade\nUpgrade: websocket\nSec-WebSocket-Accept: HSmrc0sMlYUkAGmm5OPpG2HaGWk=\nIt appears as if the header \u0026ldquo;Sec-WebSocket-Protocol\u0026rdquo; is also part of the WebSocket specification (even though BOA doesn\u0026rsquo;t use it), so it may be wise to add that to the Allow list to fully support the WebSocket protocol.\nBy allowing these headers through the firewall, Entota\u0026rsquo;s deep guidance feature works as expected.\nNOTE: It is recommended that you use Google Chrome to perform the steps below.\nTo verify that the WebSocket upgrade is successful:\n  Navigate to the Entota landing page and log in to Entota with a valid user name and password.\n  Open the Developer Tools in Chrome by going to the kebab-menu (the 3 vertical dots in the top right) \u0026gt; More Tools \u0026gt; Developer Tools.\n  Click the Network tab.\n  Type the text \u0026ldquo;events\u0026rdquo; into the Filter field to display the request that uses the WebSocket protocol.\n  In Entota , on the Jump to\u0026hellip; menu on the right, select Term to get a list of terms in your Entota system.\n  Select any of the terms.\nNOTE: Once you select the term, the \u0026ldquo;events\u0026rdquo; request displays on the Network tab of the Developer Tools panel.\n  Select the \u0026ldquo;events\u0026rdquo; item in the list and the details of that request display to the right of it.\n  Click the Headers tab.\nNOTE: If the WebSocket upgrade was successful, the Status Code value has a green LED and reads \u0026ldquo;101 Switching Protocols.\u0026rdquo; Click the Frames tab to view the actual WebSocket messages being sent and received over the socket. The term highlighting feature of deep guidance is now functioning correctly within the Term window.\n  If any other Status Code value displays, the WebSocket upgrade failed, likely due to missing (stripped out) headers.\n"

	"content": "You can implement information governance using Entota™ following one of these methods:\n Strategic (Top-Down) Approach Rule-Based (Bottom-Up) Approach Critical Data Element (CDE) Approach  []{#Strategi} Strategic (Top-Down) Approach With the top-down approach, begin by identifying the organization\u0026rsquo;s strategy - in terms of its vision, mission, goals, and initiatives. When IT and the business staff can effectively communicate strategy across boundaries, the entire enterprise can begin to leverage data as a corporate asset. As you document the organization\u0026rsquo;s strategy, begin building relationships to the organization\u0026rsquo;s critical assets. The defining of critical assets then contributes to the creation of a business glossary, data catalog, and a comprehensive set of business policies and enforceable rules. In essence, the top-down approach starts with the \u0026ldquo;big picture\u0026rdquo; and trickles down to the fine details. This approach is useful in answering the questions \u0026ldquo;Why are we doing this?\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;How does this fit in our budget?\u0026rdquo;\nThis approach is recommended for governance teams with business stakeholder involvement from the get-go. It\u0026rsquo;s critical that the business strategy is documented as perceived enterprise-wide. Teams with doubts surrounding the enterprise\u0026rsquo;s strategy should consider deferring this effort to a later phase of implementation.\n[]{#Rule-Bas} Rule-Based (Bottom-Up) Approach When there\u0026rsquo;s an existing data quality, MDM, or other data management effort in place, organizations can initiate governance by documenting the rules applied to specific data sets in Entota™, centrify the systems where those data sets come from, the business policies that necessitate the rules, and the terms that must be understood to understand the implications of each asset. Typically a collection of business policies also reveals initiatives and goals set at the enterprise and program levels.\nIf the governance effort is initiated by the IT team, it\u0026rsquo;s usually easier to begin where there are existing data management efforts - which is typically at the enforcement stage. This approach is best suited for customers already using BackOffice solutions such as dspMonitor™, dspConduct™, or other enforcement technologies.\n[]{#Critical} Critical Assets Approach A problem that many of our customers face is that governance is left solely to IT - the business staff aren\u0026rsquo;t interested in getting involved. This approach focuses on assets which are central to business operations or reporting - we call these \u0026ldquo;critical assets\u0026rdquo;. We document the systems and data sets containing these assets, assign each asset a business definition, and then document governing policies and rules. This enables IT to show value in the governance program while educating the business staff on the processes and technology involved.\nThis approach is great for governance teams still in the initial phase of information management and governance. It can provide quick value in a relatively short time frame which is sometimes crucial for maintaining a governance project.\nNo entry point to the Entota™ is better than another - it all depends on the organization\u0026rsquo;s maturity level and specific data governance environment. Each Entota™ customer has a designated Customer Success Manager who can help guide you, whichever approach you choose, and provide further expertise on implementations.

You can now set permissions for user access to Data Catalog and Strategy components. User and Approver permissions have been added to all assets. For Data Catalog, Users and Approvers are granted read-only permission only. User permission allows a user read-only access to a component. This type of user can add comments, share a URL and view change history for an asset, but cannot sponsor an asset or otherwise edit it. If a user has User permission for a component, that asset does not display in the Quick Add list because the user cannot add the asset. Additionally, guidance related to adding or editing assets does not display for a user with User permission. If a user has Approver permission, the user can sponsor an asset in the Strategy, Policy, and Glossary components. Refer to Add a User to Entota™ for more information.   IMPORTANT: With this security update, all users are granted “User” level, read-only access by default. This means that existing users no longer have the ability to edit Strategy(Visions, Missions, Goals and Initiatives), Data Sets, and Systems. To restore these permissions, the platform administrator must update these users\u0026rsquo; custom permissions for the Strategy and Data Catalog components.\n Refer to Edit a User Account for more information.\nJuly 5, 2018 Enhancements  The Status field has been added to the Goal and Initiative detail pages.
