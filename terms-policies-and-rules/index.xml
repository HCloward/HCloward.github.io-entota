      <description>Business Rules can define controls for business data to help businesses achieve goals. Rule compliance is assessed based on a true or false analysis. If the rule statement is true, the rule is achieved. If the statement is false, it is not achieved.
Rules are assigned to Policies.
As you are setting up a rule, you can click the Guidance () icon to open the Guidance panel to view assistance. Refer to Guidance for more information.</description>
